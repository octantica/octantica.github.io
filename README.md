# A Frontend Clone of oklama.com
This project is a frontend clone of Kendrick Lamar's official website, https://oklama.com, primarily developed using HTTrack, with several modifications added.

# Disclaimer
I initially did not plan to make the code open source, as it is quite messy. However, as I noticed that other clones/recreations of oklama.com did not seem to successfully implement draggable folders, which, to me, is one of the most important features of this frontend design, and many people have been asking how to achieve this, I decided to make this repository public.
